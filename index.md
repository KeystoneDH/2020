# July 8-10, 2020<br/>@ Temple University

<br/>

**While we were hoping we could report otherwise, this year's Keystone DH conference is canceled.**

Thank you all for your work this year helping to put this event together. We are grateful for your wide-ranging contributions. Because a core feature of this conference would be the use of the Charles Library's new spaces, and because of our limited bandwidth, we are not considering hosting the conference virtually. Instead, we are planning to postpone the conference until the summer of 2021. 

Expect another call for papers and a call for currently accepted participants to submit again this coming winter.  

Questions? Feel free to contact us at **contact@keystonedh.network**.
