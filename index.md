## Keystone DH 2020 is now accepting proposals*!*  
Deadline extended to February 1, 2020.

<a class="button button-dark-blue" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyIe3KUDXoXSUe_bF3CZ2fuOB0LAP6jPkXWyo0DsvKgsNcHQ/viewform" target="_blank">Proposal Submission Form</a>

<br/>

We are excited to announce that this year’s Keystone DH will be held at Temple University in Philadelphia. Keystone DH is an annual conference and a network of institutions and practitioners committed to advancing collaborative scholarship in digital humanities research and pedagogy across the Mid-Atlantic.

Proposals are welcome on any aspect of digital technologies and their application to the humanities and/or social sciences. We highly encourage projects that focus on the collaborative nature of research and teaching. Senior scholars should foreground the labor of students, librarians, and/or the community that sustained the project. We especially welcome proposals with representative and inclusive speaker involvement.

Presentations may take the form of short papers, panel discussions or roundtables, workshops, poster sessions, or showcase demonstration. All panels and workshops will take place over 1.5 hours, unless otherwise requested. If you are interested in running a longer hackathon, please email contact@keystonedh.network. The conference will include allotted times for a poster session and showcase demonstrations (including presentations that use the Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio’s [VR Lab](https://library.temple.edu/spaces/34) and/or [Makerspace](https://library.temple.edu/spaces/28)). Please keep in mind that presentations and documents will be expected to meet accessibility guidelines. 

In [the linked Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyIe3KUDXoXSUe_bF3CZ2fuOB0LAP6jPkXWyo0DsvKgsNcHQ/viewform), please submit your name, email address, title, and type of your proposed presentation, as well as a proposal of 200-300 words. The proposal deadline is **February 1st, 2020**, and proposers will be notified by early March 2020.

We will be offering a number of student bursaries to support those presenting at the conference. This will include a conference fee waiver and funds to partially cover travel and accommodations.
